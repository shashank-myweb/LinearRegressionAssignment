## General Information
- This project is about Data analysis for a Consumer finance company which is in the business of providing Loans to Indian Customers
- Present a set of Insights and Recommendations based on 'Consumer attributes' and 'Loan attributes' to the Company, so that 
- Lending money to Loan applicants who may default is minimized, or 
- Present alternative choices to risky applicants, such as different terms and conditions for Loans like higher interest rate or less Loan principal amount approved.
- Historical dataset is provided which contains data of past loan applicants and whether they 'defaulted' or 'not'.
Basically, this means that whether the Loan takers paid the loan as per terms and conditions or not.

## Approach
The approach we will follow is the standard approach to analyze a data set which is raw in nature. Hence we will apply the following methodologies to clean the data, understand the nature of data and arrive at a list of data columns which are required from a final analysis perspective. A list of steps that we are going to follow are as follows. Data sourcing has already been mentioned :
Data cleaning
- Univariate Analysis
- Segmented variate Analysis
- BiVariate Analysis
- Derived Metrics, if any
- Collate and conclude on findings to arrive at suggestions
